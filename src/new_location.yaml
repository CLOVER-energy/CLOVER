# Entries consist of directory-and-file information used when creating a new
# location.
#
# An example entry is provided below for a single file contained withinm a
# directory:
# - directory: <directory name>
#   contents:
#   - file: <file contained within the directory>
#     contents: <contents of the file>
#
# For large files, use the `|-` literal-style block-scalar character to tell
# YAML that the text is split across several lines.
#
# For files that contain many repeated lines, use the following format:
#   contents: |-
#     23:foo,bar,baz
# This will tell the new-location script to repeat the specified line 23 times.
# This is done to save space within this YAML file.
